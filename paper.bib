	abstract = {Background: Sports levels, baseline patient-reported outcome measures ({PROMs}), and surgical procedures are correlated with the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ({ACLR}). Machine learning may be superior to conventional statistical methods in making repeatable and accurate predictions.
Purpose: To identify the best-performing machine learning models for predicting the objective and subjective clinical outcomes of {ACLR} and to determine the most important predictors. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: A total of 432 patients who underwent anatomic double-bundle {ACLR} with hamstring tendon autograft between January 2010 and February 2019 were included in the machine learning analysis. A total of 15 predictive variables and 6 outcome variables were selected to validate the logistic regression, Gaussian naı¨ve Bayes machine, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}), isotonically calibrated {XGBoost}, and sigmoid calibrated {XGBoost} models. For each clinical outcome, the best-performing model was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}), whereas the importance and direction of each predictive variable were demonstrated in a Shapley Additive Explanations summary plot.
Results: The {AUC} and accuracy of the best-performing model, respectively, were 0.944 (excellent) and 98.6\% for graft failure; 0.920 (excellent) and 91.4\% for residual laxity; 0.930 (excellent) and 91.0\% for failure to achieve the minimal clinically important difference ({MCID}) of the Lysholm score; 0.942 (excellent) and 95.1\% for failure to achieve the {MCID} of the International Knee Documentation Committee ({IKDC}) score; 0.773 (fair) and 70.5\% for return to preinjury sports; and 0.777 (fair) and 69.2\% for return to pivoting sports. Medial meniscal resection, participation in competitive sports, and steep posterior tibial slope were top predictors of graft failure, whereas high-grade preoperative knee laxity, long follow-up period, and participation in competitive sports were top predictors of residual laxity. High preoperative Lysholm and {IKDC} scores were highly predictive of not achieving the {MCIDs} of {PROMs}. Young age, male sex, high preoperative {IKDC} score, and large graft diameter were important predictors of return to preinjury or pivoting sports.
Conclusion: Machine learning analysis can provide reliable predictions for the objective and subjective clinical outcomes (graft failure, residual laxity, {PROMs}, and return to sports) of {ACLR}. Patient-specific evaluation and decision making are recommended before and after surgery.},

	abstract = {Robust and rabid mortality prediction is crucial in intensive care units because it is considered one of the critical steps for treating patients with serious conditions. Combining mortality prediction with the length of stay ({LoS}) prediction adds another level of importance to these models. No studies in the literature predict such tasks for neonates, especially using time-series data and dynamic ensemble techniques. Dynamic ensembles are novel techniques that dynamically select the base classifiers for each new case. Medically, implementing an accurate machine learning model is insufficient to gain the trust of physicians. The model must be able to justify its decisions. While explainable {AI} ({XAI}) techniques can be used to handle this challenge, no studies have been done in this regard for neonate monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit ({NICU}). This study utilizes advanced machine learning approaches to predict mortality and {LoS} through data-driven learning. We propose a multilayer dynamic ensemble-based model to predict mortality as a classification task and {LoS} as a regression task for neonates admitted to the {NICU}. The model has been built based on the patient’s time-series data of the first 24 h in the {NICU}. We utilized a cohort of 3,133 infants from the {MIMIC}-{III} real dataset to build and optimize the selected algorithms. It has shown that the dynamic ensemble models achieved better results than other classifiers, and static ensemble regressors achieved better results than classical machine learning regressors. The proposed optimized model is supported by three well-known explainability techniques of {SHAP}, decision tree visualization, and rule-based system. To provide online assistance to physicians in monitoring and managing neonates in the {NICU}, we implemented a web-based clinical decision support system based on the most accurate models and selected {XAI} techniques. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://github.com/{InfoLab}-{SK} {KU}/{neonateMortalityPrediction}.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction ({DR}) techniques have been consistently supporting high-dimensional data analysis in various applications. Besides the patterns uncovered by these techniques, the interpretation of {DR} results based on each feature’s contribution to the low-dimensional representation supports new finds through exploratory analysis. Current literature approaches designed to interpret {DR} techniques do not explain the features’ con­ tributions well since they focus only on the low-dimensional representation or do not consider the relationship among features. This paper presents {ClusterShapley} to address these problems, using Shapley values to generate explanations of dimensionality reduction techniques and interpret these algorithms using a cluster-oriented analysis. {ClusterShapley} explains the formation of clusters and the meaning of their relationship, which is use­ ful for exploratory data analysis in various domains. We propose novel visualization techniques to guide the interpretation of features’ contributions on clustering formation and validate our methodology through case studies of publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate our approach’s interpretability and analysis power to generate insights about pathologies and patients in different conditions using {DR} results.},
